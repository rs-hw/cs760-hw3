\section{Questions (50 pts)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item (9 pts) Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem. And, provide the number of data points ($n$) and the number of features ($p$).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (3 pts) We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in predicting CEO salary with given factors.
	
	\begin{soln} Regression problem, since salary is a continuous output space, with $n$ = 500 and $p$ = 3 (all features i.e. number of employees, industry and profits can have correlation in estimating CEO salary). \end{soln}
	
	\item (3 pts) We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously launched. For each product we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.
	
	\begin{soln}  Binary classification problem with $n$ = 20 and $p$ = 13. \end{soln}
	
	\item (3 pts) We are interesting in predicting the \% change in the US dollar in relation to the weekly changes in the world stock markets. Hence we collect weekly data for all of 2012. For each week we record the \% change in the dollar, the \% change in the US market, the \% change in the British market, and the \% change in the German market.
	
	\begin{soln}  Regression problem because percentage change is a continuous output space. We will have $n$ = 52 data points and $p$ = 3 corresponding to the 3 stock market change information available. \end{soln}
	
\end{enumerate}

\item (6 pts) The table below provides a training data set containing six observations, three predictors, and one qualitative response variable.

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ c  c  c  c}
		\hline
		$X_{1}$ & $X_{2}$ & $X_{3}$ & $Y$ \\ \hline
		0 & 3 & 0 & Red \\
		2 & 0 & 0 & Red \\
		0 & 1 & 3 & Red \\
		0 & 1 & 2 & Green \\
		-1 & 0 & 1 & Green \\
		1 & 1 & 1 & Red  \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Suppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for $Y$ when $X_{1} = X_{2} = X_{3} = 0$ using K-nearest neighbors.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (2 pts) Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and the test point, $X_{1} = X_{2} = X_{3}=0$.
 
	\begin{soln}  		Euclidean distance is given by $\sqrt{X_1^2 + X_2^2 + X_3^2}$.
		The Euclidean distance from each observation to the test point $(0,0,0)$ is tabulated below.\\
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ c  c  c  c c}
				\hline
				$X_{1}$ & $X_{2}$ & $X_{3}$ & $Y$ & Euclidean distance \\ \hline
				0 & 3 & 0 & Red & 3\\
				2 & 0 & 0 & Red & 2\\
				0 & 1 & 3 & Red & 3.162\\
				0 & 1 & 2 & Green & 2.236\\
				-1 & 0 & 1 & Green & 1.414\\
				1 & 1 & 1 & Red & 1.732\\
				\hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center} \end{soln}
 
	\item (2 pts) What is our prediction with $K=1$? Why?
	
	\begin{soln}  For K=1, we consider the qualitative response of the closest neighbor observation. For the test point, we have $X_1=-1,X_2=0, X_3=1$ belonging to the class Green to be the closest neighbor. Hence, the prediction would be \textbf{Green}.\end{soln}
	
	\item (2 pts) What is our prediction with $K=3$? Why?
	
	\begin{soln}   For K=3, we consider the qualitative response of the 3 closest neighbor observations. In this case, we have the labels \{Green, Red, Red\} corresponding to the distances \{1.4, 1.7, 2\} to be the nearest neighbours of the test point. Hence, the prediction would be \textbf{Red},1 corresponding to the majority class. \end{soln}

\end{enumerate}

\item (12 pts) When the number of features $p$ is large, there tends to be a deterioration in the performance of KNN and other local approaches that perform prediction using only observations that are near the test ob- servation for which a prediction must be made. This phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality, and it ties into the fact that non-parametric approaches often perform poorly when $p$ is large.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (2pts) Suppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements on $p=1$ feature, $X$. We assume that $X$ is uniformly (evenly) distributed on [0, 1]. Associated with each observation is a response value. Suppose that we wish to predict a test observation’s response using only observations that are within 10\% of the range of $X$ closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with $X=0.6$, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65]. On average, what fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?
	
	\begin{soln}  The prediction range for a test observation is expected to be in the range $[x-0.05, x+0.05]$ for test observations in the range $[0.05, 0.95]$. Since X is uniform, and the interval is 0.1, $\frac{1}{10}$ of the available observations will be used to make the predictions.  \end{soln}
	
	
	\item (2pts) Now suppose that we have a set of observations, each with measurements on $p =2$ features, $X1$ and $X2$. We assume that predict a test observation’s response using only observations that $(X1,X2)$ are uniformly distributed on [0, 1] × [0, 1]. We wish to are within 10\% of the range of $X1$ and within 10\% of the range of $X2$ closest to that test observation. For instance, in order to predict the response for a test observation with $X1 =0.6$ and $X2 =0.35$, we will use observations in the range [0.55, 0.65] for $X1$ and in the range [0.3, 0.4] for $X2$. On average, what fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?
	
	\begin{soln} Since X1, X2 are distributed uniformly over a unit square. Hence, $0.1*0.1 = \frac{1}{100}$ of the combined observations would be used to make a prediction.\end{soln}
	
	\item (2pts) Now suppose that we have a set of observations on $p = 100$ features. Again the observations are uniformly distributed on each feature, and again each feature ranges in value from 0 to 1. We wish to predict a test observation’s response using observations within the 10\% of each feature’s range that is closest to that test observation. What fraction of the available observations will we use to make the prediction?
	
	\begin{soln}  Similar to the first two questions, we can say that the fraction of available range of observations tends to $0.1^{100}$ when $p=100$ \end{soln}
	
	\item (3pts) Using your answers to parts (a)–(c), argue that a drawback of KNN when p is large is that there are very few training observations “near” any given test observation.
	
	\begin{soln}  From the results of (a) and (c), it is evident that the number of available observations in the proximity of a test observation diminished exponentially with respect to the the number of features $p$. Hence, it is true that KNN is not useful to categorize test observations based on neighbours under the context of high-dimensionality of the input space. \end{soln}
	
	\item (3pts) Now suppose that we wish to make a prediction for a test observation by creating a $p$-dimensional hypercube centered around the test observation that contains, on average, 10\% of the training observations. For $p =$1, 2, and 100, what is the length of each side of the hypercube? Comment on your answer.
	
	\begin{soln} From (a), we know that $p=1$ hypercube would have a side length of 0.1. For $p=2$, we can use euclidean distances to infer a side length of $\sqrt{0.1}$. Generalizing, this observation we have a side length of $0.1^{1/p}$ for a p-dimensional space. Hence, for $p=100$, we have $0.1^\frac{1}{100}$. This shows that the prediction space decreases with dimensionality highlighting that there are very few observations near any given test observation.  \end{soln}
	
\end{enumerate}

\item (6 pts) Supoose you trained a classifier for a spam detection system. The prediction result on the test set is summarized in the following table.
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l l | l l}
		&          & \multicolumn{2}{l}{Predicted class} \\
		&          & Spam           & not Spam           \\
		\hline
		\multirow{2}{*}{Actual class} & Spam     & 8              & 2                  \\
		& not Spam & 16             & 974               
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Calculate
\begin{enumerate}
	\item (2 pts) Accuracy
	\begin{soln}   $\frac{8\ +\ 974}{1000} = 0.98$  \end{soln}
	\item (2 pts) Precision
	\begin{soln}  $\frac{8}{8\ +\ 16} = 0.33$  \end{soln}
	\item (2 pts) Recall
	\begin{soln}  $\frac{8}{8\ +\ 2} = 0.8$  \end{soln}
\end{enumerate}


\item (9pts) Again, suppose you trained a classifier for a spam filter. The prediction result on the test set is summarized in the following table. Here, "+" represents spam, and "-" means not spam.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c  c }
\hline
Confidence positive & Correct class \\ \hline
0.95 & + \\
0.85 & + \\
0.8 & - \\
0.7 & + \\
0.55 & + \\
0.45 & - \\
0.4 & + \\
0.3 & + \\
0.2 & - \\
0.1 & - \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item (6pts) Draw a ROC curve based on the above table.
	
	\begin{soln}  		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{rocM.png}
		\end{figure} \end{soln}
	
	\item (3pts) (Real-world open question) Suppose you want to choose a threshold parameter so that mails with confidence positives above the threshold can be classified as spam. Which value will you choose? Justify your answer based on the ROC curve.
	
	\begin{soln} Given the ROC curve in this example, a TP-rate of 0.55 would be a reasonable trade-off since the FP-rate increases significantly beyond that point which would mean missing mails that are not spam. \end{soln}
\end{enumerate}

\item (8 pts) In this problem, we will walk through a single step of the gradient descent algorithm for logistic regression. As a reminder,
$$f(x;\theta) = \sigma(\theta^\top x)$$
$$\text{Cross entropy loss } L(\hat{y}, y) = -[y \log  \hat{y} + (1-y)\log(1-\hat{y})]$$
$$\text{The single update step } \theta^{t+1} = \theta^{t} - \eta \nabla_{\theta} L(f(x;\theta), y) $$



\begin{enumerate}
	\item (4 pts) Compute the first gradient $\nabla_{\theta} L(f(x;\theta), y)$.
	
	\begin{soln}  		\begin{aligned} $
			\nabla_{\theta} L(f(x;\theta), y) & = \nabla_{\theta} [- y \log(\sigma(\theta^\top x))) - (1 - y) \log(1 - \sigma(\theta^\top x))]\\
			& \frac{-y}{\sigma(\theta^\top x)} \cdot \sigma^\prime(\theta^\top x) \cdot x - \frac{1-y}{1 - \sigma(\theta^\top x)} \cdot - \sigma^\prime(\theta^\top x) \cdot x\\
			& \frac{-y}{\sigma(\theta^\top x)} \cdot \sigma(\theta^\top x)(1 - \sigma(\theta^\top x)) \cdot x + \frac{1-y}{1 - \sigma(\theta^\top x)} \cdot \sigma(\theta^\top x)(1 - \sigma(\theta^\top x)) \cdot x\\ 
			& - xy (1 - \sigma(\theta^\top x)) + x(1-y) \sigma(\theta^\top x)\\
			& x (-y + y \sigma(\theta^\top x) + \sigma(\theta^\top x) - y \sigma(\theta^\top x))\\
			& x (\sigma(\theta^\top x) - y) $
		\end{aligned}\end{soln}
	
	\item (4 pts)
 Now assume a two dimensional input. After including a bias parameter for the first dimension, we will have $\theta\in\mathbb{R}^3$.
$$ \text{Initial parameters : }  \theta^{0}=[0, 0, 0]$$
$$ \text{Learning rate }\eta=0.1$$
$$ \text{data example : } x=[1, 3, 2], y=1$$
Compute the updated parameter vector $\theta^{1}$ from the single update step.
	
	\begin{soln}  		
            \begin{aligned}$
			\theta^1 & = \theta^0 - 0.1 \cdot [1,\ 3,\ 2] (\sigma([0,\ 0 ,\ 0]^\top [1,\ 3,\ 2]) - 1)\\
			& \theta^0 - 0.1 \cdot [1,\ 3,\ 2] (\sigma(0) - 1)\\ 
			& \theta^0 - 0.1 \cdot [1,\ 3,\ 2] (\frac{1}{2} - 1)\\ 
			& [0.05,\ 0.15,\ 0.1]$
		\end{aligned} 
        \end{soln}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Programming (50 pts)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item (10 pts) Use the whole D2z.txt as training set.  Use Euclidean distance (i.e. $A=I$).
	Visualize the predictions of 1NN on a 2D grid $[-2:0.1:2]^2$.
	That is, you should produce test points whose first feature goes over $-2, -1.9, -1.8, \ldots, 1.9, 2$, so does the second feature independent of the first feature.
	You should overlay the training set in the plot, just make sure we can tell which points are training, which are grid.
 
	\begin{soln}  Generated plot with red=1 and blue=0. \end{soln}
	\begin{figure}[h]
